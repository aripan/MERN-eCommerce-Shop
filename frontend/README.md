## Usage

You can login using the following credentials:

- Username: test@example.com
- Password: password

Or you can Register a new account using fake email/password .

## Notes

1. The Web App uses SSL encryption through HTTPS protocol to transfer input data.

2. Passwords are hashed once received by the backend.

3. Despite 1 and 2, I'd still recommend using a fake/weak password to avoid any potential future attacks.

4. Fake emails can be used to register due to the fact that emails will not be verified.

## Last but not least

1. Sometimes the server responds slow for login/register requests, so please be patient.

2. However, do check your browser console for any potential bad requests or errors.

3. Raise an issue in case you find any.
